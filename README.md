This is a Node.js project hosted on Cloud9 IDE!

With a static `express` server, and using Angular 1.5 components, I display data obtained from the public World Bank API

https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/topics/125589-developer-information.

## Running the server

1) Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

3) Open localhost:3030
